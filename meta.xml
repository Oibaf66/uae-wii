    <long_description>UAE is an Amiga emulator written by Bernd Schmidt et al, see http://amigaemulator.org. 
The initial port to Wii was done by Simon Kagstrom, with help from Christopher Follett, "Knitax".
The project is now carried out by Fabio Olimpieri (Oibaf).

USAGE
---------
Wiimote 1 acts as both mouse in port 1 and joystick in port 2. 
To use Wiimote as mouse you have to point it towards the screen, also for the buttons.
Some games require the disabling of the mouse emulation to work; others require the disabling of the second and third joystick buttons.
You can also use a real mouse plugged into the usb port.
The graphic virtual keybord uses the IR Wiimote pointer.

This is the default configuration for Wiimote in horizontal position:

version 2:
                * Fix bug where the nunchuk analogue controller and
                  the DPAD would not work at the same time

                * Lots of menu improvements (pressing 1 will now go
                  back to the last menu for example)

                * Enable use of harddisks

                * Fix save/restore state

		* Add virtual keyboard (for binding joystick buttons to keyboard keys)

                * Load a uaerc.user if it exists. This is also saved when configuration changes and it
                  overrides stuff from uaerc

                * Allow setting of Amiga type (from PSPUae / FOL)

                * Better default configuration (from PSPUae / FOL)
